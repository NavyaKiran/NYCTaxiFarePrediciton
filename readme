* PROBLEM STATEMENT
The main objective of the project was to develop a model to predict the yellow taxi fare amount in New York City. 
I considered a range of factors within the dataset as well as weather related factors. 
I utilized PySpark, Spark SQL, Google BigQuery and Python for the process of analyzing the data and building predictive models.

* DATA DESCRIPTION
I obtained the data from two different sources. My first source was the nyc.gov website for the yellow taxi trip data and taxi zones data. 
To enable efficient processing of the dataset, I made the decision to utilize January and February trip data. 
The other source was Google BigQuery’s open dataset. I obtained the weather and weather station data from BigQuery.
I utilized queries written in Spark SQL to combine the data from these tables resulting in a dataset with over 500k rows and 43 columns.

* PREDICTION AND INFERENCE GOAL
Conduct exploratory data analysis in order to identify factors that influence the total fare amount of a yellow taxi in New York City and provide actionable insights to stakeholders 
to enable better resource optimization.
Utilize Apache Spark’s MLLib library in order to build predictive models using linear regression, 
decision trees and random forest with fare amount as the dependent variable.

* RESULTS 

* In Queens, Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island, the fare distributions show distinct peaks suggesting common 
fare ranges within each borough. Manhattan has the highest frequency 
of fares in the middle range, which might indicate a combination of trip lengths and traffic conditions unique to Manhattan.

* Fares in the outer boroughs like Queens and Staten Island show wider distributions, 
suggesting more variability in trip distances and possibly less consistency in pricing or travel patterns compared to Manhattan.

* The overall fare amount distribution across NYC indicates a strong peak at the lower end, 
which suggests that short to medium-range trips are most common.

* The steep drop-off past the initial peak implies that high-cost rides are relatively rare, 
which could be due to long-distance trips being less frequent or alternative transportation options for such distances.

* The scatter plot does not show a clear correlation between the number of passengers and 
the fare amount, implying that the number of passengers may not significantly impact the fare, 
considering that fares are often flat rates irrespective of passenger count, up to the vehicle's capacity.

* Single-passenger rides dominate the distribution, indicating that most taxi trips are taken solo. 
There's a sharp decline in frequency as the number of passengers increases, suggesting that group rides are less common.

* Trip distance distribution shows that short trips are more common than longer ones, with a steep decrease as distance increases.

* The density of pickups and dropoffs in specific areas highlight the hotspots for taxi activities. 
Central and Downtown Manhattan have the highest concentration of taxi activity, while airports also show significant activity levels.

* Drop-off heatmaps show that some areas are more popular as destinations than as pickup locations, 
which could be indicative of commuting patterns or popular venues/attractions.

* There's a notable trend in trip counts varying by day of the week, with a significant drop on Sundays, 
which may reflect lower demand for taxis on the traditional "rest day" or non-workday for many people.

* Week-of-month trip distribution displays a dip towards the end of the month. 
This might be due to monthly financial cycles affecting transportation spending.

* Histograms for fares to and from JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark airports 
show peaks at certain fare amounts, which could indicate standard airport rates or 
common distances from key areas in the city to these airports.

* Scatter plots examining fare against weather conditions suggest a weak correlation 
between precipitation or temperature and the average fare, though ride frequency seems to 
decrease slightly on days with higher precipitation, which might be due to people preferring not to travel in adverse weather conditions.

* Temperature appears to have a more complex relationship with the number of rides, 
where both very low and high temperatures might be associated with increased taxi usage, 
possibly due to discomfort from walking in such conditions.

* The average fare seems to fluctuate slightly over the weeks, but there isn't a clear upward or downward trend, 
indicating that fare prices are relatively stable over time. However, 
there's a slight increase in average fares during mid-weekdays, which could be related to higher business activity.
